## Service Icons

In my role I sometimes need to draw architectural diagrams - I much prefer to code, but alas, sometimes you need to explain.

I use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io) as my drawing package so I have removed all the unnecessary files from the icon sets (EPS, VSS and Adobe etc) to create just the icon sets.

The files remain owned by their owners and are duplicated here solely for each of use and centralization.

If you have another icon set that you think would be useful or the icons become out of date raise a PR and I will merge it.
